## Features

- ðŸŽ§ Real-time pitch detection using autocorrelation
- ðŸŽ¨ Interactive and responsive analog meter
- ðŸ”„ Supports multiple buffer sizes and input devices
- ðŸŽ» Intelligent status feedback (Perfect, Sharp, Flat)
- ðŸŽ¼ Adjustable A4 tuning reference (400â€“480 Hz)

---

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10
- `numpy`
- `pyaudio`
- `scipy`
- `tkinter` (included by default with most Python installations)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy pyaudio scipy
```

> If you're using a virtual environment, activate it first.

---

## Usage

```bash
python ATuner.py
```

- Select your input device (microphone) and buffer size
- Press **"Start Tuning"** to begin
- Optional: Click **"Settings"** to customize the reference A4 pitch

## Supported Instruments

This tuner is particularly optimized for violin, detecting:

- G3 (196.0 Hz)
- D4 (293.7 Hz)
- A4 (440.0 Hz)
- E5 (659.3 Hz)

But it also works for any instrument in the ~80â€“3000 Hz range.
